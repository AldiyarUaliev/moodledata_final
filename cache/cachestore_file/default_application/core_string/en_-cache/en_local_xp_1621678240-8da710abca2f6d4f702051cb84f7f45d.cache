The rules below determine when students earn points for the grades they receive.

Students will earn as many points as their grade.
A grade of 5/10, and a grade of 5/100 will both award the student 5 points.
When a student's grade changes multiple times, they will earn points equal to the maximum grade they have received.
Points are never taken away from students, and negative grades are ignored.

Example: Alice submits an assignment, and receives the mark of 40/100. In _Level up!_, Alice receives 40 points for her grade.
Alice reattempts her assignment, but this time her grade is lowered to 25/100. Alice's points in _Level up!_ do not change.
For her final attempt, Alice scores 60/100, she earns 20 additional points in _Level up!_, her total of points earned is 60.

To display the top 5 teams instead of the teams neighbouring those of the current user, set the parameter `top`. You can optionally set the number of teams to display by giving `top` a value, like so: `top=20`.

```
[xpteamladder top]
[xpteamladder top=15]

A link to the full ladder will automatically be displayed below the table if there are more results to be displayed, if you do not want to display such link, add the argument `hidelink`.

```
[xpteamladder hidelink]

By default, the table does not include the progress column which displays the progress bar. If such column has been selected in the additional colums in the ladder's settings, you can use the argument `withprogress` to display it.

```
